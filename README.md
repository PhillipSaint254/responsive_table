# A Simple Responsive HTML Table
- This code starts with a default desktop size screen as is with the default HTML table design.
- Background colors have been added to make sure the table, rows and columns are standing out.
- In small screen, I convert the display of the table data to a grid kind of layout for responsiveness.
- To make sure the browser still process the grid type of system as it would a table, I followed [this article](https://adrianroselli.com/2018/05/functions-to-add-aria-to-tables-and-lists.html)
- In end, this was what I was able to achieve on the desktop view
